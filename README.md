LastFM Spotfiy Scrobbler Server
-------------------------------

A simple web service automatically scrobbles users Spotify playes to Last.fm. It run's every ten minutes, and checks the 50 last played.

## Why?

When using Spotify Connect to play music, my music isn't scrobbled to LastFM. Plus I don't have to set up Spotify everytime I install it or use a new client.
