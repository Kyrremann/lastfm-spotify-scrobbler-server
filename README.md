LastFM Spotfiy Scrobbler Server
-------------------------------

A simple web server that runs on Heroku and scrobbles my last played list at Spotify.

## Why?

When using Spotify Connect to play music, my music isn't scrobbled to LastFM. Using https://github.com/kyrremann/spotify-connect-scrobbler (forked) I'm able to run a scheduled task on Heroku which scrobbles my missing songs.
