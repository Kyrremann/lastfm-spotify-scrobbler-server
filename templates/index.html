<h1>Scrobbler.io</h1>
<p>Welcome to this simple Spotify to Last.fm scrobble service. What we do is to
  listen to your last played tracks on Spotify and scrobble them to your Last.fm
  account. Which makes your scrobbling easier, as you don't have to log into
  each of your units, or to miss out on scrobbles for when you are using Spotify
  Connect.</p>
